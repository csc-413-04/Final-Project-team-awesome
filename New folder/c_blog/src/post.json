Next, mash an avocado in a small bowl with a fork. Add cilantro, lime, and salt + pepper then spread the mixture on the toasted slice of bread. Sprinkle with pepper flakes and serve!\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re having it for breakfast go ahead and top the avocado with an egg cooked any way you like. Our favorite is a sunny side up but poached, scrambled or even hard-boiled also works well."},{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5c1c775bad7ba04d2884837d"} , "username" : "Shota" , "title" : "How to make Sandwich" , "body" : "Step 1: get bread\r\nStep 2: put food in it\r\nStep 3: eat it\r\n"}]}
